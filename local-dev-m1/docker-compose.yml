# https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-762
# To use an altnerative JDBC driver (which is faster, but not allowed to be default in Apache distribution)
# replace org.drizzle.jdbc.DrizzleDriver with com.mysql.jdbc.Driver in DRIVERCLASS_NAME and fineract_tenants_driver,
# and remove ":thin:" from SUB_PROTOCOL and fineract_tenants_url.  Note that the mysql-connector-java-*.jar is already
# bundled in the container by the Dockerfile, but just not used by default.
