This is the source of the official Apache Fineract Java Client library.

It is mostly autogenerated using **Swagger Codegen**, but includes a number of hand-written utility classes to aid in its usage.

There is some [documentation about it here](https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/fineract-doc/src/docs/en/chapters/sdk/client.adoc).

Please contribute improvements to this (a submodule of Apache Fineract) if this client library has gaps for what you need it for.
