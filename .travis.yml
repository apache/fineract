# NOTE: We used to run with --info, which is quite a bit more verbose, but is VERY useful to understand failures on Travis,
# where you do not have access to any files like build/reports/tests/index.html, only the Console.
# @see http://mrhaki.blogspot.ch/2013/05/gradle-goodness-show-more-information.html
# @see http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/whats_new_in_gradle_1_1_test_logging for alternative
# https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-732 removed that again, because it made Travis CI fail.

# using "&&" instead of several "-" means that integrationTest does not run if test fails,
# and Docker test does not run if integration test fails, which makes PR failure easier to understand.
