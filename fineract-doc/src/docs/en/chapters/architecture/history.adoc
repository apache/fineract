== The Idea

Fineract was an idea born out of a wish to create and deploy technology that allows the microfinance industry to scale. The goal is to:

* Produce a gold standard management information system suitable for microfinance operations
* Acts as the basis of a platform for microfinance
* Open source, owned and driven by member organisations in the community
* Enabling potential for eco-system of providers located near to MFIs
