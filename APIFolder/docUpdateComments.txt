\loan\?\transactions\id get exception if loan doesn't match id.... should loan be taken out here?
template for waiver/repayment... is it same for both? no type needed? (might have got this wrong)
new loan template ... is it 2 templates... one to pick product... and 2nd to return default properties in selected product or is it meant that if only one product then use that.

Lost permissions again... restore fixed it up... must be some prob with permissions/roles maintenance
also, maybe I should be using a user that has everything but role admin.

go thru questions over mandatory fields
also about formation numbers with locale... can i put a dodgey one in and mess up data unknowingly?

Permissions
groupType in or out?

users - delete still falls over if user doesn't exist.
Roles

"id" is a mandatory field (says something about updating in the msg)

Loan Products
List/Retrieve - should show textual values of enums?
Create - currencyDigitsAfterDecimal is it needed? (maybe customising digits after decimal by loan product not just currency) 
	is locale saved?
	principal is later called principalMoney

Clients
displayName, externalId, maxJoinedOnOffsetFromToday
joinedDateFormatted still there,
update doesn't work if officeId not there.
