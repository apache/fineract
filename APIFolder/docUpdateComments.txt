\loan\?\transactions\id get exception if loan doesn't match id.... should loan be taken out here?
template for waiver/repayment... is it same for both? no type needed? (might have got this wrong)

new loan template ... is it 2 templates... one to pick product... and 2nd to return default properties in selected product or is it meant that if only one product then use that. 


--------------------------------------------------------


Users
template:   allowedOffices (only id 1 came back)... does allowedOffices and available Roles depending on requested permissions?
Retrieve a user: selectedRoles- possible json prob availablePermissions is blank... is it always?
create new user... didn't check repeatPassword (see example in docs) but does in update
  and msg shown on duplicate username isn't useful.
  takes 4/5 seconds!

update: give hardtofigureout error msg when using equivalent to create parameters...worked ok with ones in docs tho.
delete: does delete (I delete super1), no 200 ok returned,  "org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: attempt to create merge event with null entity; " if delete a non-existant user

Offices (creates and updates not working with last commit)
When creating new offices.. do i have to supply  "dateFormat": & "openingDateFormatted" for openingDate?  What is list of dateFormats?
openingDate seems mandatory... but when the 'pair' not supplied I get NullPointerException
could just openingDate be used?
Note that openingData is passed as openingDateFormatted and a dateFormat is provided to convert the date from the way your UI records it to a common format.
hierarchy update results in exception (prob  solved by using unrecognized parameter exception)

Loan Product
List - interestRateCalculatedInPeriod is it usefult to show this field...also enums questionsor show only a few cos on loan template
Create - get NullPointerException when creating using values in api doc (? about using principal or principal formatted or the right locale values)
Update - tried to update name (using api docs data) and got a NullPointerException

Clients
List - can't get client other than from office 1
template - only get office 1 in allowed offices

mandatoryfields - if pass {}
dates lose formatted - general docs, money... strings, locale, don't have to put in commas.....but do put in decs.



--------------------------------------------------------

Permissions
groupType in or out?

Roles
"id" is a mandatory field (says something about updating in the msg)
