POSSIBLE CHANGES TO APP OR DOCUMENTATION


list clients notes - noteType needs a 'text' DOING
	createdOn & updatedOn values... do they need reformatting? DOING

loan template - repaymentSchedule is null - I can't see it set in the app - used in preview schedule functionality maybe? - probably not used and will be deleted


loan retrieve DOING
   break up data into categories.. e.g. 
   Basic - lifeCycleStatusText thru
   Convenience - open thru waitingForDisbursal then maxSubmittedOnOffsetFromToday, maxApprovedOnOffsetFromToday , maxDisbursedOnOffsetFromToday, actualLoanTermInDays,    actualLoanTermInMonths,  loanTermInDays, loanTermInMonths
   Permission - undoDisbursalAllowed, waiveAllowed, makeRepaymentAllowed, rejectAllowed, withdrawnByApplicantAllowed, undoApprovalAllowed, disbursalAllowed, anyActionOnLoanAllowed
   flatten loadData
       repaymentSchedule
       summary
       loanRepayments


Loan Transitions ... approve etc - possible done
    if  "eventLocalDate" parameter added with string date then instead of parameter not support msg do get jackson conversion exception.
    approve loan (already closed) with approval date before submitted date
    The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>org.mifosng.platform.loan.domain.InvalidLoanTimelineDate: The     date    of when loan is approved cannot be before its submittal date.

   approve loan (already closed) with approval date after submitted date
    Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null

   if I do an approve when already approved also get
   Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null


   sometimes clientId returned... always loanId OK? DOING


Loan Transactions (repay and waive - and maybe reversal - but not disbursement) general talk needed as retrieve could work for any txn?
    transaction type... UNKNOWN(0), DISBURSEMENT(1), REPAYMENT(2), REVERSAL(3), WAIVED(4);
    Create - (command has string and proper value fields... so assume its like eventDate above)

    retrieve: display transaction type value?  DOING
    "principal" : null,   "interest" : null, total, "totalWaived" : null,   "overpaid" : null, and the offset - are nulls ever put in? DOING
    adjust:

    when adjusting a disbursal - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:         Only repayment and waiver transactions can be adjusted. DONE
    on create and adjust, app returns clientId can it be transaction id or loanId?



BUT NOT FOR NOWS
should be able to get clients by branch as well
also get loans of different status's by branch etc
list of loan transactions not available (except in summary - presume repayments section has repayments and waivers and adjusts)




DOCUMENTATION REMAINING

Just Errors section to do in the Overview section

Identify Fields that need explaining
=========================
bit of loan product/loan

repayment/waiver - describe waiver
why fields "totalWaived", "overpaid"


take aout /v1 from resource name.

maxJoinedOnOffsetFromToday

    - create a client example could show second example with the
field clientOrBusinessName being used instead of firstname, lastname,
no mention of it.
    - mention if optional externalId is provided, it must be unqiue?
    - TODO - check update of client with 'clientOrBusinessName' with
a first name/last name results in error

 - Loans
     - digitsAfterDecimal and currencyCode should NOT be sent during
creation - they should be inherited from the product. Likewise for
update.
     - Would be better if it was possible to not pass any of these
details if defaults from loan product are acceptable, they can be
inherited from loan product.
